        <h1>Weapons</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Detail, depth and choice define every aspect of Red Dead Redemption 2, and weapons are no exception.
            There are over 50 unique usable weapons, a massive range of options for customization, and a wide
            selection of different ammunition types to improve accuracy, range or damage. The more a gun is used,
            the better it will perform, but it will also start to degrade over time if not looked after, so a trusty
            sidearm needs to be kept oiled and clean.

        <h2>Weapon Choice & Customization</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            With a myriad of customization options ranging from visual upgrades like new metals, woods, varnishes and
            engravings to performance upgrades like new barrels, grips, sights and scopes, you can design an entirely
            unique weapon that looks and handles exactly the way you want it to. Every weapon’s performance varies in
            terms of damage, range, fire rate, accuracy and reload speed so it’s important to pick wisely depending on
            the situation. The high fire rate of a Double-Action Revolver lends itself well to shooting on the move from
            horseback. If you’re carrying something in one hand, like a lantern or small animal, consider using a
            Sawed-Off Shotgun which packs a much bigger punch at close range than other one-handed weapons. The Varmint
            Rifle is perfect for hunting small game because it’s far less likely to damage the quality of the skin and
            meat than a firearm with a bigger shell size. When faced with just one or two enemies, you might want to go
            for a Springfield Rifle which has a slower fire rate but delivers much higher damage. For range, a sniper
            rifle of some kind is obviously a good choice, but scopes can also be fitted to all other types of rifle
            enabling you to switch between regular view and scope view at any time.

                Carry single handed pistols, revolvers and the single handed Sawed-Off Shotgun in your holsters.
                Upgraded and reinforced holsters will protect the weapons from degradation against the elements while
                Off-Hand Holsters give you the ability to dual wield.
